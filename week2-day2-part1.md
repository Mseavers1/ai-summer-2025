#### 2 Click <span class="mark">Gemini API</span>

#### 4 Log in if needed

You may be prompted for your gmail credentials if you&rsquo;re not already signed in. If you are, use them to verify your identity. Take any additional steps needed for a second verification step if required.

#### 5 Click <span class="mark">Get API Key</span>

#### 7 Select or create project

You will be prompted to Create an API Key &ndash; either by creating a new project or from an existing project. Either create a new project if you don&rsquo;t have one or select an existing project (probably &ldquo;Generative Lang Client&rdquo; if you have existing projects).

#### 8 Verify API Key existence

Sometimes, API providers do not allow you to view API keys more than once, but in this case, Google does. You&rsquo;ll need this API key, but you can always come back here and find it. Verify that you have something of the form below:
