# AI Summer
> Summary repository for AI Summer 2025. Introduction to generative AI, with practical applications for inferencing and training
> May 5-30, 2025

Presented by Vanderbilt Data Science Institute data scientists:
* Dr. Jesse Spencer-Smith, Chief Data Scientist
* Dr. Charreau Bell, Senior Data Scientist
* Myranda Shirk, Senior Data Scientist
* Umang Chaudhry, Senior Data Scientist
* Dr. Abigail Petulante, DSI Postdoctoral Fellow

## Overview
The objective of these workshops is to develop foundational skills in understanding, inferencing and training generative AI models and other transformer models.  

## Getting Ready for AI Summer

### Learn or Improve Your Python

Practice your Python skills using the below documents. Choose either a Google Colab for interactive programming environment, or alternatively read through the Google Doc.

- [Colab Notebook Format](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PRpyEJQyQc-h3mdKuY2awCEhsHcP8AZ0?usp=sharing)

- [Google Doc Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUjOkKSZ-YY4R_562IoOQxTZvDZ2MGn-w_lURC8acBo/edit?usp=sharing)

### Getting Accounts

You’ll want to use the most advanced AI chat model that you can get access to. To get a headstart, please create an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). We will go over instructions on how to create API keys and more during the sessions. 


### Decide on a Project (recommended)

Think about any data you might want to bring to the workshop. Also begin thinking about any projects you might want to accomplish during our month. We’ll have office hours for you to work with us to get your first project off the ground!

## Workshop Schedule and Recordings

Session will run live from 11am-1pm, with an office hour from 1pm to 2pm (all times Central).

## Breakout Rooms

### How to Breakout

Remember we are all learning and exploring
- Please share your video upon entering the room and unmute
- Share your screens--someone volunteer to share their screen upon entering, and everyone be ready to share your screen to show what you’ve found
- Make notes of what you’ve discussed in the Response Reports below
- Everyone be ready to report out (random)
- Make some friends
- Breakout Rooms Worksheets

### Report Documents
Google Docs has a limit of 100 people viewing/editing a document at one time. 


### Special Breakout Room Groups

Please be sure your display name is set in Zoom. If you are in one of the following special groups, please pre-pend your name with one of the following qualifiers. 
- Data Science for Social Good: DSSG
- Center for AI in Protein Dynamics: Protein
- If you are in a lab and would like your own breakout room: Labname (keep it short, please!)
- If you are faculty and would like to be in a breakout room with other faculty: Faculty

For example, I might be *DSSG-Jesse Spencer-Smith*
